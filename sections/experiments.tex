\subsection{Sequences of MNIST digits}
	arbitrary sequences of images.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Sequence1 is a simple linear sequence of digits 0-9 repeating.
		\item Sequence2 introduces one bit of parity by alternating sequences 0-9 and 9-0 repeating, where the next value depends on whether the sequence is ascending or descending.
		\item Sequence3 creates a longer, more complex sequence by introducing a second bit of parity. It is formed by:
	\end{itemize}
