This is the experiments section.

\subsection{Sequences of MNIST digits}
	arbitrary sequences of images.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Sequence1 is a simple linear sequence of digits 0-9 repeating.
		\item Sequence2 introduces one bit of parity by alternating sequences 0-9 and 9-0 repeating.
		\item Sequence3 gives a slightly longer-term time dependency.
		\item Sequence4 creates a more non-linear sequence with two bits of parity.
	\end{itemize}

\subsection{Sequences of polyphonic music}
	midi stuff.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Piano-midi.de .......
		\item Nottingham .....
		\item MuseData ....
		\item JSB chorales .....
	\end{itemize}
